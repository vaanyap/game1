Buttercup is out sick, and Blossom has been held captive by Mojo Jojo (the monkey). He demands gold, or else he will kill Blossom. We must free Blossom before it's too late. 

We must avoid all the obstacles the monkey throws at us by using the arrow keys to move up and down and back and forth. Press space to throw the arrows and destroy the fireballs. By touching Blossom, you will be able to defeat the evil monkey.
